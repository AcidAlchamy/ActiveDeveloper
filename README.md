# Active Developer Project README

## Overview

Welcome to the **Active Developer** project, an innovative initiative aimed at promoting active development within the Discord community. Our project encompasses a unique approach to recognize and support those who contribute to the vibrant ecosystem of Discord bot development. By offering an open-source Discord bot, named "Active Developer", we not only provide a platform for users to gain the coveted "Active Developer" badge but also create a collaborative space where developers can share knowledge, collaborate, and enhance their skills.

## Features

- **Active Developer Badge:** A prestigious badge awarded to users who demonstrate consistent engagement and maintenance of a Discord bot.
- **Open Source Bot:** Access to the "Active Developer" bot's code, enabling users to create their own version with a personal Bot Token.
- **Community Hub:** A centralized Discord server and GitHub repository where developers can collaborate, learn, and grow together.
- **OAuth2 Auto-Authorization:** Simplified bot authorization process through our free service, [Discord OAuth2](https://www.sportsbots.io/DiscordOAuth2.html), eliminating the need for individual server updates.

## How It Works

1. **Clone and Deploy:** Start by cloning the "Active Developer" bot, customize it with your Bot Token, and deploy it to your server.
2. **Engage with the Community:** Participate in our Discord server and GitHub repository to share ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with fellow developers.
3. **Maintain Active Development:** Regularly update and improve your bot, demonstrating your active role in the Discord developer community.

## Bot Features

The "Active Developer" bot includes a range of functionalities to enhance your server experience:

- **Slash Commands:** Easy-to-use commands like `/active_developer`, `/github`, `/how_does_it_work`, `/bot_tips`, and `/docs` for various programming language libraries.
- **Interactive Responses:** Engaging button interactions to express interest in becoming an active developer.
- **Educational Content:** Tips, best practices, and documentation links for Discord bot development.
- **Database Integration:** SQLite database for managing server information.
